### About lunkwill
lunkwill is a very fast and simple-to-setup issue tracking system coming along with a git integration to
read logs, show commits and view diffs in browsers over the network. We created our own webserver to which
other browsers can connect. lunkwill also doesn't need very much RAM or CPU power. It's working very well,
even on our Raspberry Pi.

However, lunkwill and its
modules are still in development. We keep coding!
